# Games-Miniproject2
The project aims to analyze and visualize video game sales and engagement data to uncover trends in game popularity, user behavior, and platform performance. By merging sales and engagement data, we seek to offer insights into how game features, platforms, and genres influence sales, wishlists, and ratings.
